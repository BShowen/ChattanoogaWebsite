                            The Lookout Mountain Incline Railway is a popular tourist attraction with a long history in Chattanooga. <span class="hidden">Hop inside on of the train cars for a 1 mile ride to the top of Lookout Mountain. The railway has a grade of 72.7% making it the world steepest train ride. The first Incline Railway opened in 1886 and closed in 1895 before being taken down in 1900. The second Incline Railway opened in 1895 and its popularity was the reason that the first Incline Railway was closed. When the Incline Railway opened it was used as a main mode of transportation to the top of the mountain. Originally the cars were powered by coal-burning steam engines before being converted over to electric cars in 1911. The cable that pulls the cars up the track are the same cables used in the Brooklyn Bridge. The Incline Railway is now one of Chattanooga's main tourist attractions serving over 100,000 visitors annually.</span>

                            Ruby Falls is a set of underground waterfalls, some more than 145 high, located more than 1,100ft underground inside of Chattanooga's Lookout Mountain. <span class="hidden">Ruby Falls was discovered on accident by a man named Leo Lambert. He was a chemist and had an interest in caves. He bought land on top of lookout mountain and began drilling straight down in search of another known cave system called Lookout Mountain Cave. After drilling 1,120 feet he discovered an crack in the rocks about 18inches in diameter. Driven by curiosity, Lambert and his team crawled through this space for 17 hours until they reached the waterfall that is now called Ruby Falls.</span>
